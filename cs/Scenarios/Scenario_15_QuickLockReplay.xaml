                    Majority of BLE devices do not require Bluetooth pairing (bonding), 
                and as a result the communication is not encrypted on Bluetooth link layer.
                It can of course be secured on application layer (data payload) -
                for example using vendor's proprietary encryption or encoding. 
                But in many cases, the authentication relies on sending just plain, static credentials
                (like in the previous task with password) - that can be intercepted and then simply replayed by an attacker.

                    Scroll down some packets to see actual data (read/write/notification).
                    By the way, note that actual low-level communication is based on
                    <Bold>Handles</Bold> - incremental numbers assigned to each Attribute (Service, Characteristic, Descriptor, ...). 
                    Wireshark however is able to display the service and characteristic UUIDs associated with handles.
                    Note that this manufacturer used "short", reserved UUIDs for his proprietary service - not in accordance to Bluetooth specification.

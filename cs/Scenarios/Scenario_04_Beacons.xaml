                   BLE advertisements are often used to broadcast some unique device identifiers, 
                    which can be used for example to identify specific device or pinpoint very precise indoor location of the receiving smartphone.
                    Practical implementations include for example: displaying local context information in a shop or gallery, automatic "check-in", integration with home automation, tracking users,
                    or triggering other location based action.
                   One of the most commonly used formats is BLE iBeacon. The broadcasted packet contains:

                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    - <Bold>UUID</Bold>, for example "00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff" - usually specific for vendor or installation
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    - Two numbers (0-65535): <Bold>Major</Bold> (usually common for group of devices) and <Bold>Minor</Bold> (for individual device).

                <Paragraph Margin="10,0,0,0">
                    - transmission signal strength <Bold>RSSI</Bold>, used to calculate the actual distance from device.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    The beacon numbers are broadcasted as "manufacturer specific" (0xFF) data type in BLE advertisement packets.

                    Your HackMe device advertisement has just changed. 
                    It does not broadcast its name any more (nRF Connect shows N/A), has different flags (no "CONNECT" button), 
                    and the Bluetooth address should also have changed.

                    1. During the process of changing into a different simulated device, as a side effect you may notice several inactive "ghost" devices in nRF Connect, 
                    each with a different Bluetooth address. Swipe down the scan results to refresh the view and discard these unwanted "ghosts".
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph Margin="10,5,0,0">
                    2. Your Windows still "glitches" with its own advertisement independently (visible with Windows icon in nRF Connect). Due to Windows restrictions, 
                    it may have higher priority now than in previous tasks, so the HackMe would switch to "iBeacon" just for a very short, tricky to catch moment.
                    For better experience, you can temporarily
                    <Bold>turn off these Windows BLE packets</Bold> in your system, by disabling responsible functionality. Open Settings -> Shared experiences, turn off "Nearby sharing" and "Share across devices" options.
                    From now on, you should see only BLE HackMe advertising packets.

                    The iBeacon advertisement should look like this:

                    Take a look at the "RAW" iBeacon packet
                    (Note: if your raw packet starts with "0x1EFF0600" it means you caught this Microsoft packet, not iBeacon).
                    You will quickly notice that there is no mystery - the data is simply embedded as raw hex into "0xFF" (Manufacturer Specific") field:

                    You may have noticed also a "CLONE" button by the advertisement details.
                    Yes, you guessed right - it allows to copy the advertisement data, and turn your phone into BLE device advertising "clone" ("Advertiser" tab).
                    The feature has some exceptions, for example cannot clone device name, but cloning iBeacon data will work.

                    Your task is to note the iBeacon advertisement parameters, especially Major and Minor numbers (randomly generated for you).

                    try restarting (Bluetooth interface, application, computer). If that does not help, you may be unlucky case of setup that does not advertise custom Bluetooth packets, 
                    and you won't be able to solve "Beacons" and "Manufacturer Specific Advertisements" tasks. Don't worry, skip to the next task with "Connections".

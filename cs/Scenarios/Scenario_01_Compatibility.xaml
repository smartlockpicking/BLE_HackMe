                    Hello and welcome to Bluetooth Low Energy hardware-less hackme!
               </Paragraph>

                    The project aims to introduce the BLE protocol and its security basics.
                Your computer with Bluetooth interface will simulate various BLE devices - on the radio layer working exactly as real ones.
                In a series of tasks you will get familiar with BLE advertisements, beacons, connections, take control over talking BLE smart bulb, 
                reverse-engineer the communication, brute force passwords, and even hack real smart lock!
               </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    For solving the tasks you will need Android phone (iOS has limited low level BLE features). 
                It is also possible to use other BLE tools, for example running on Linux, 
                however details are not covered here and you are on your own.
                </Paragraph>

                    In a rare case when your Windows system is "N" edition (for example Windows Professional N), it comes without a media pack, required for a few tasks.
                    Please install "Microsoft Media Feature Pack".
                    If your system has Windows Media Player available (standard), you are good to go.

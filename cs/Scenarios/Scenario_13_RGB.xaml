                    A typical BLE device comes with an associated mobile application to control its behaviour.
                The data exchanged with device (sent from the phone via writes and received back via reads/notifications), 
                may range from simple, single bytes ("00"/"01"), through slightly more sophisticated (more bytes, extra "header" and "checksum"),
                up to very complex and encrypted protocols. 
                It may be more difficult to guess the correct data compared to the simple light bulb switch from previous tasks.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    With a very few exceptions (where mobile application acts as a dumb 'proxy' sending BLE commands to device directly from the cloud),
                the protocol logic is embedded in the mobile application. So, having insight into application source code, you could determine how the BLE communication works.                
                The source code is obviously not available directly for end users, who download binary versions of applications from Play Store.
                Decompiling Android binaries is however in most cases surprisingly simple task.
                First, the application binary (apk) has to be retrieved - for example from special, unofficial sites (look for "apk download").
                Next, a decompiler can be used against the binary.
                Popular choices include for example

                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                    Unless developers took extra steps to prevent it (binary code obfuscation, using native C instead of Java...), 
                the resulting decompiled Java code - although different than original - is readable enough to understand the application logic.

                    Mobile application reversing technical details are beyond the scope of this BLE HackMe, 
                there are however plenty of resources and tutorials on the topic easily available.

                    The light bulb has yet another characteristic, which allows to change its color and brightness level.
                You will surely find it in the light bulb service. The valid data format to send via write is however unknown.

                    Fortunately, there was a mobile application possible to decompile.

                    Your task is to analyse the decompiled source code, and based on it 
                create a valid request to light bulb RGB characteristic - setting it to half-dim pure red.

                    Of course you can then set any color and brightness level you like.

                    The decompiled method "a" (original method name compressed to single letter) takes a 32-bit integer as an input, and then using

                    splits it into alpha (dim), red, green and blue single bytes (8 bit).
                    Next, it creates a new byte array "bArr" (which looks like a communication protocol frame), 
                    and then probably sends it to device via BLE using another method "this.c.e.b".

                    It means, the decimal value of the bits is not 0...255, but rather -128...127.
